Week 2 H/W
==========

1. Write a function named "mysqrt" which takes two arguments of **y** and **tol**
   that finds sqrt(**y**) using the bisection method with tolerence of **tol**.

   - By definition, we need to estimate $x$ where $y=x^2$. 
     For a given $y$, $x$ is a positive root of $f(x) = x^2 - y$.

   - You may utilize the bisect function from the lecture note, or you
     may develop your own bisect function.

   - For **tol**, the return value need to satisfy $|f(x_n) - y| < tol$. 

2. Write a same function, but using a Newton-Raphson iteration.

   - For $x_n$ near the root of function $f$,  Newton-Raphson
     method estimate the next approximation $x_{n+1}$ by

     $$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f^{\\prime}(x_n)}$$.

   - For sqrt, 
      
     $$x_{n+1} = (x_n + \\frac{y}{x_n})/2$$


3. Write a function that finds root of a function (similar to the
   bisection method) but using a :red:`regula falsi` method. 

   - :red:`regula falsi` method is similat to the bisect method, but 
     the bisecting point is selected as

       $$c = a - f(a) \\frac{b - a}{f(b) - f(a)}$$

     for the given interval of $a$ and $b$.

   - Note that, during the lecture, I called it as a secant method
     and this seems to be a mistake. The secant method refers to a
     different method (although very similar).
     
For this homework, you may find following link useful.

The homework must be submitted via email by March 27, 11am.
And you need to submit the python code files.
